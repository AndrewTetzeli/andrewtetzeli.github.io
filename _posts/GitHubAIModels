Here's some good news about and from the great DevOps platform, GitHub:
"We are launching GitHub Models, enabling our more than 100 million developers to become AI engineers and build with industry-leading AI models."
<https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-github-models/>

The GitHub Models will use sandboxes to contain code execution. These will be "playgrounds" where developers can deploy and use various AI models to develop and test software.
Then the software can be integrated into development environments and eventually production. 

This development is a very promising one for software and AI development and integration. The beta of GitHub Models could be the start of something great. Thank you, GitHub!
